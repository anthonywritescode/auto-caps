auto-caps
=========

an auto capitalization user extension!

I don't like capitalization (can you tell?) so I promised chat I'd add an
extension which auto-capitalizes words in github text boxes in exchange for
some gift subs.  but it turns out they're all kinda broken so I wrote my own.

currently it is installable via [tampermonkey / greasemonkey]
